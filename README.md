This application was not completed, because there are some incompatibilities between the used libraries and the version of react-native (0.62.2).
Some of these are:

- Axios: It was not possible to post images, data is not sent, generating the Network Server error. This error, according to research on the internet, as in github issues, informs that the current version is really with this problem. Thus, as soon as a solution is found, the project will continue. It is noteworthy that it was also not possible to carry out the post with fetch, indicating possible other flaws and / or incompatibilities in the axes and / or in the multer, or even in the code itself developed.

- Date-fns: The distanceInWords function is no longer part of the lib. Despite this, another function was used to achieve the objective.

- React-Native-fs: The function is not compatible with version 0.62.2 of react native.

- React-Native-FileViewer: The function is not compatible with version 0.62.2 of react native.


However, the backend and web frontend have been completely development
